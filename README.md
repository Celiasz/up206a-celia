## About me
My name is Celia Sanchez Zelaya (sher/her) and I am a second-year MURP concentrating in Environmental Analysis and Policy. I am interested in resilience, climate adaptation, and hazard mitigation. I came straight from undergrad, but have had the opportunity to do work in the nonprofit, private and public sector. Originally, I am from El Salvador, but have lived in the San Gabriel Valley for the past 15 1/2 years.


## UP 206A Introduction to GIS
I'd love to learn how to make a map with Python. I've heard about the possibilities even with a Python plug-in on QGIS! All of my mapping skills come from ArcMap so this is will make my knowledge more expansive. 


## Project Ideas
I am hoping that my project will focus on making sure that the County of Los Angeles is able to handle new infrastructure needs as extreme heat events will become from prominent. This includes looking at existing, official cooling centers in the County and comparing it to the new climate projections for 2040. In result, the County can become more aware of new areas that will be in need of more cooling centers or to designate a center as temperatures rise.
